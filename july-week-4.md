#July Week 4

## Todo

* **Edit Feed and Medication Record** - create a function that edits feed intake and medication of selected pig
* **View Movement Details and Weight** - display graph that describes the movement details of pig and weight details of pig

## Done

* **Edit Feed and Medication Record** - I created a function that selects all the feed record and medication record of the selected pig from the database. I stored the values in an array and displayed it through a table in the UI. each row in the table has a dropdown box so that the feed name and/or medication name can be easily edited by the user. The feed and medication type will be automaticaly changed afterwards.  

## To be done

* **view Movement Details and Weight** - I'm not done with view movement of pig beacause I need to study how to make a graph using javascript.

## Things learned

* Do not make your solution too complicated.

## Hardest task done this week

* **Edit Medication and Feeds** - I need to show in every row of the table a dropdown that has a list of feed or medication names. But when I called the function that select the feed or medication names using ajax, each row in the table has a single value of the feed or medication name in the dropdown. I still don't solve this
