#July Week 5

## Todo

* **Admin page** - create an admin page where the admin can add user, farm, house, pen, parentage, breed, feed, medication

## Done

* **Admin Page** - I used Bootstrap modals to easily organize the page.  

## To be done

* **view Movement Details and Weight** - I'm not done with view movement of pig beacause I need to study how to make a graph using javascript.

## Things learned

* Always think of a more simpler solution or algorithm.
* Do not make your solution too complicated.

## Hardest task done this week

* **Insert Medication and Feeds** - I find it hard to think of a simpler way to select all checkboxes values when "Select All" is checked. Then I realized that I can still used arrays to store the values and it can be used in the whole program.
