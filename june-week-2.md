#June Week 2

## Todo

* **View Pig Details** - incorporate backend functions to the frontend
* **select farm, house, pen , pig** - create a modal function that shows when Add (farm, house, pen, pig) is selected
* **insert pig** - incorporate the backend functions to the frontend.

## Done

* **select farm, house, pen, pig** - I used jquery to call the modal when Add (farm, house, pen, pig) is selected in the dropdown list

## To be done

* **view pig details** - I'm not done with view movement of feed beacause I need to study how to make a graph using javascript.

## Things learned

* Always communicate with your supervisor about the tasks given.
* Consult with teammates if you are unsure with your implementation. Ask for suggestions.

## Hardest task done this week

* **insert pig function** - I needed to pass values from one route to another. The values must not be passed through URL's. So I figured out that it would be better to have the insert pig in one route and have divs hidden to show some transitions in the UI.
