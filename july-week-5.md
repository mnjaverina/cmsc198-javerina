* **View Movement Details and Weight** - display graph that describes the movement details of pig and weight details of pig

## Done

* **Admin Page** - I used Bootstrap modals to easily organize the page. I created functions that add user, farm, house, pen, parentage, breed, feed , and medication. I linked the backend to the frontend using AJAX.
* **View Movement Details and Weight** - I created a function for view movement and view weight. I user Amcharts in javascript to create graphs. I used line graph for the movement and bar graph for the weight.

## To be done

* none

## Things learned

* I learned how to make charts/graph in javascript.

## Hardest task done this week

*  **View Movement Details and Weight** - I find it hard to learn how to make graphs in javascript. I tried to study certain tutorials in the internet. I also asked by supervisor to teach me. When I'm starting to create the functions, I find it also hard to define the styles used in creating graphs.
