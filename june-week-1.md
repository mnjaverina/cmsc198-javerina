#June Week 1

## Todo

* **Login** - create a login function(backend) and connect with frontend
* **select farm, house, pen and pig** - create functions that retrieve farm, house, pen and pig and also connect it with the frontend.
* **generating downloadable intake report** - create a function that generates retrieved feed intake record of each pig and convert it to a downloadable file formats, e.g. pdf, .docx, .xls, .csv.

## Done

* **Login** - I used session to store the selected username, password, and user id from 
			  the database based from the inputted username and password by the user. (30 mins).
* **generating downloadable feed intake report** - I downloaded fpdf library to help me in implementing the function. As well as in implementing the generateExcel function, I also used a downloaded library - PHPExcel. (8 hours for pdf, 5 hours for excel)

## To be done

* **select farm, house, pen and pig** - The frontend part for this module is still unfinished. Though I'm finished implementing the functions needed, the frontend part must be finished first before  I add the scripts and connect the backend part to the frontend. 
* **generating downloadable intake report** - It's hard to implement for the are many ways to implement it. I'm studying some tutorials on how to best implement these functions. 

## Things learned

* Always ask your supervisor/teacher/instructor. We must not always assume details about the tasks given to us.
* Follow the coding schemes/ templates given.

## Hardest task done this week

* **generating downloadable intake report** - create a function that generates retrieved feed intake record of each pig and convert it to a downloadable file formats, e.g. pdf, .docx, .xls, .csv.
											  I have already done with the function that generates pdf and excel files and I finished it through searching and learning ways on how to create a function
											  for the given task. I also downloaded a library that makes the function easier to create. I have asked the help of my supervisor and she said that I can
											  always download libraries that can help in implementing the function. I learned that downloading libraries is not as harmful as it may seem though as a
											  developer, we must be familiar with the functions inside the libraries we are using.
