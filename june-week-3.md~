#June Week 3

## Todo

* **View Movement Details and Weight** - display graph that describes the movement details of pig and weight details of pig
* **Insert Medication and Feeds** - Add medication and feed intake record of either by pig/s or by pens.
* **Insert Weight** - Add to weight record the weight of selected pig/s of pig batch/es

## Done

* **Insert Medication and Feeds** - I created a function that selects all pigs in a given pen and all pens in a given house from the database. I also created a function that selects all pigs or pens when checkbox "Select all" is checked. In that function, I store all the values of the pigs or pens in an array and call that array when Add button is clicked to store the Medication and Feed informations. I used AJAX to call the functions.
* **Insert Weight** - Same with Insert Medication and Feeds, I created a function that selects all pigs and pig batches from the database. I also created a function that selects all pig checkboxes and batch checkboxes when checked. 

## To be done

* **view Movement Details and Weight** - I'm not done with view movement of pig beacause I need to study how to make a graph using javascript.

## Things learned

* Always think of a more simpler solution or algorithm.
* Do not make your solution too complicated.

## Hardest task done this week

* **Insert Medication and Feeds** - I find it hard to think of a simpler way to select all checkboxes values when "Select All" is checked. Then I realized that I can still used arrays to store the values and it can be used in the whole program.
